/**
 * A semi-port of [Overrides] from AutoCommon using the XProcessing APIs.
 * https://github.com/google/auto/blob/master/common/src/main/java/com/google/auto/common/Overrides.java
 *
 * Determines if one method overrides another. This class defines two ways of doing that:
 * [NativeOverrides] uses the method [Elements.overrides] while [ExplicitOverrides] reimplements
 * that method in a way that is more consistent between compilers, in particular between javac and
 * ecj (the Eclipse compiler).
